Bugs:
FarmID not visible in some reports due to a TableView glitch
Sorting by FarmID also buggy in some scenarios due to another TableView glitch

To run the program:
Use the provided executable file “executable.jar”
Otherwise, using run configurations, add to the VM arguments the path to your java fx and then run main through the console

Future work:
Find a workaround for the TableView glitches, otherwise, find a different method of showing a table
Add different ways of representing the data. Eg. A bar chart
Improve the UI quality using external tools(could not do now due to the assignment specifications)
Allow for farms to add descriptions to their entries. Eg. Farm 12 performed poorly in June due to a shortage of labour
